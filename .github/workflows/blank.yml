# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: |
          echo TEST
          
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Decrypt large secret
        #run: ./decrypt_secret.sh
        run: |
          echo TEST
        env:
          LSP: ${{ secrets.API_TEST_KEY }}
      # This command is just an example to show your secret being printed
      # Ensure you remove any print statements of your secrets. GitHub does
      # not hide secrets that use this workaround.
      - name: Test printing your secret (Remove this step in production)
        #run: cat $HOME/secrets/my_secret.json
        run: |
          echo ${{ LSP }}

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
